        "Event Description": "Hopewell Eating Disorder Support Centre will hold its third annual signature fundraiser in the Horticulture Building at Lansdowne Park on Wednesday, October 23rd. It will bring people together to \"break bread\" and use this opportunity to further \"break stigma\u201d around these deadly mental illnesses. \nThis is important because while eating disorders are the most fatal mental health diagnosis, they remain grossly misunderstood and heavily stigmatized. Breaking bread together will give our guests a chance to learn more about why Hopewell's work is so vital in our community. \nThe concept for the evening is a gourmet sandwich showdown, featuring a roster of Ottawa's top chefs, and a panel of celebrity judges to crown the \"Sandwich Sovereign of Ottawa\"\nThe accomplished chefs who will be competing are: Cory Baird from Eldon\u2019s, Shane Brown from Beckta, Justin Champagne from Bar Lupulus.  We are also welcoming back a team of new student chefs from the Algonquin College Culinary Management program!\nThe inaugural winner from 2017, Joe Thottungal from Coconut Lagoon, has signed on as the official Event Patron for Breaking Bread, Breaking Stigma! He is coming back this year to cook the reception food and he will also serve on the panel of celebrity judges, which includes local culinary royalty Margaret Dickenson, and Gusto Worldwide Media CEO Chris Knight.\nThank you to our event sponsors; GUSTO Worldwide Media, Excel HR, Taggart Parkes Foundation, Parson Refrigeration Ltd., Susan Chell Team - REMAX Hallmark Reality, INNOVISOR, Westboro Psychology, Pearly-Robertson, Hill and McDougall LLP, and Anchor Psychology. \n\nThere will also be a silent auction of exciting prizes available on-site, and a bar featuring complementary wines from KIN Vineyards. Flora Hall will also be donating beer and fielding a chef for the competition (TBA).\n\n\n\nFAQs \nWhy are you holding a food-related event for an eating disorder charity?\nBecause food is the medicine that takes our clients from illness to wellness, and from hopelessness to recovery. It is also an opportunity to celebrate the amazing diversity of local chefs, whose life's work is providing this nourishment for all of us.\nWhat accomodations will be made for those with dietary restrictions?\nDue to the nature of the event, the chefs are only able to make adjustments for vegetarians (by providing an alternate protein), and those with Celiac disease or a severe gluten allergy (by using gluten-free bread). Please email info@hopewell.ca after you have purchased your tickets to inform us if you require either or both of these adjustments to be made for you. Those who do not inform the organizers in advance of these requirements may not be able to be accomodated on-site.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\nNo, however a host bar will be available for those aged 19 and older. Non-alcoholic options will also be available.\nWill you be issuing a tax receipt to ticket buyers?\nAbsolutely! Tax receipts will be issued by the end of November 2019.\nWhat are my transportation\/parking options for getting to and from the event?\nLansdowne Park is easily accessible by walking and cycling. OC Transpo service on Bank Street also provides easy connections from downtown. The underground parking garage has over 1000 spots available at rates of $2.00 for 30 minutes, and a $30 daily maximum.\nHow can I contact the organizer with any questions?\nPlease email info@hopewell.ca \nWhat's the refund policy?\nNo refunds will be provided after ticket purchase."

        "Event Description": "Please join us on Thursday, November 14, 2019 at the London Convention Centre for our Fall Banquet & Silent Auction featuring keynote speaker Perdita Felicien, World Champion Hurdler and Two-Time Olympian.  \nIt is with great pleasure that we announce this year\u2019s speaker: two-time Olympian, 10-time, National Champion, two-time World silver medalist, and the only Canadian woman to win a World Championship gold medal in track and field. During her career as a 100-metre hurdler she earned numerous honours, including Canada\u2019s Athlete of the Year and the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Medal. In her inspiring talks, Perdita explores what it means to chase a dream and overcome the \u201churdles\u201d life can put before you.\nIn high school, after briefly quitting track altogether, P erdita earned a full scholarship to the University of Illinois, and became a three time NCAA champion and a cademic standout. Her success continued as a professional when she represented Canada at six World Championship competitions, and at two Olympic Games in 2000 and 2004. A favourite at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Perdita fell at the first barrier in the finals and couldn\u2019t finish the ra ce. She showed grace under fire in that moment, and has used the experience to teach others how to pers evere and rise again. \nAfter retiring in 2013, Perdita has worked as a broadcaster, covering the 2015 Pan American Games and the summer Olympics in Rio for the CBC. Perdita credits a women\u2019s shelter in Durham Region with helping her family get on their feet. Her mother who immigrated from St. Lucia, encountered many barriers , including displacement and poverty, which she found a way to overcome. Perdita\u2019s story is incredibly emotional, and is loaded with raw honesty and humour.\nHighlighted this year will be the Prevention of Homelessness Among Families (PHAF) Program at Rotholme Women\u2019s & Family Shelter. Rotholme is a branch of Mission Services of London that offers safe shelter, nourishment, counseling and other support services to families in need, and PHAF is a perfect example. PHAF has three components: 1) Shelter Diversion, to help families at risk of homelessness avoid emergency shelter; 2) Housing Selection for families who cannot be diverted to help them find stable housing; and 3) Housing Stability to help families with life skills coaching and ongoing support after they exit emergency shelter."

The Roundtable is where we gather -- the table is Round because we\u2019re in this together and need one another\u2019s voices.  It\u2019s a place of inspiration, learning, sharing, and equipping.  It is a space where diverse ministries, services, and individuals find one another in order to bring about action that would please the heart of Jesus, as He sees us welcoming the stranger in our midst and showing the mercy that He first offered us.\n This year's theme is \"PLACE\" looking into thoughts from Exodus 33:21:\n\u201cThen the LORD said, \"There is a place near me where you may stand on a rock.\u201d\n\n\nWe are also offering a pre-roundtable Professional Development training on Trauma Counselling.\nRegistration includes continental breakfasts and lunches!\n\nTo volunteer at the event, please email us at rhpnavolunteers@gmail.com and someone will connect with you!"

        "Event Description": "Hopewell Eating Disorder Support Centre will hold its third annual signature fundraiser in the Horticulture Building at Lansdowne Park on Wednesday, October 23rd. It will bring people together to \"break bread\" and use this opportunity to further \"break stigma\u201d around these deadly mental illnesses. \nThis is important because while eating disorders are the most fatal mental health diagnosis, they remain grossly misunderstood and heavily stigmatized. Breaking bread together will give our guests a chance to learn more about why Hopewell's work is so vital in our community. \nThe concept for the evening is a gourmet sandwich showdown, featuring a roster of Ottawa's top chefs, and a panel of celebrity judges to crown the \"Sandwich Sovereign of Ottawa\"\nThe accomplished chefs who will be competing are: Cory Baird from Eldon\u2019s, Shane Brown from Beckta, Justin Champagne from Bar Lupulus.  We are also welcoming back a team of new student chefs from the Algonquin College Culinary Management program!\nThe inaugural winner from 2017, Joe Thottungal from Coconut Lagoon, has signed on as the official Event Patron for Breaking Bread, Breaking Stigma! He is coming back this year to cook the reception food and he will also serve on the panel of celebrity judges, which includes local culinary royalty Margaret Dickenson, and Gusto Worldwide Media CEO Chris Knight.\nThank you to our event sponsors; GUSTO Worldwide Media, Excel HR, Taggart Parkes Foundation, Parson Refrigeration Ltd., Susan Chell Team - REMAX Hallmark Reality, INNOVISOR, Westboro Psychology, Pearly-Robertson, Hill and McDougall LLP, and Anchor Psychology. \n\nThere will also be a silent auction of exciting prizes available on-site, and a bar featuring complementary wines from KIN Vineyards. Flora Hall will also be donating beer and fielding a chef for the competition (TBA).\n\n\n\nFAQs \nWhy are you holding a food-related event for an eating disorder charity?\nBecause food is the medicine that takes our clients from illness to wellness, and from hopelessness to recovery. It is also an opportunity to celebrate the amazing diversity of local chefs, whose life's work is providing this nourishment for all of us.\nWhat accomodations will be made for those with dietary restrictions?\nDue to the nature of the event, the chefs are only able to make adjustments for vegetarians (by providing an alternate protein), and those with Celiac disease or a severe gluten allergy (by using gluten-free bread). Please email info@hopewell.ca after you have purchased your tickets to inform us if you require either or both of these adjustments to be made for you. Those who do not inform the organizers in advance of these requirements may not be able to be accomodated on-site.\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\nNo, however a host bar will be available for those aged 19 and older. Non-alcoholic options will also be available.\nWill you be issuing a tax receipt to ticket buyers?\nAbsolutely! Tax receipts will be issued by the end of November 2019.\nWhat are my transportation\/parking options for getting to and from the event?\nLansdowne Park is easily accessible by walking and cycling. OC Transpo service on Bank Street also provides easy connections from downtown. The underground parking garage has over 1000 spots available at rates of $2.00 for 30 minutes, and a $30 daily maximum.\nHow can I contact the organizer with any questions?\nPlease email info@hopewell.ca \nWhat's the refund policy?\nNo refunds will be provided after ticket purchase."

        "Event Description": "Please join us on Thursday, November 14, 2019 at the London Convention Centre for our Fall Banquet & Silent Auction featuring keynote speaker Perdita Felicien, World Champion Hurdler and Two-Time Olympian.  \nIt is with great pleasure that we announce this year\u2019s speaker: two-time Olympian, 10-time, National Champion, two-time World silver medalist, and the only Canadian woman to win a World Championship gold medal in track and field. During her career as a 100-metre hurdler she earned numerous honours, including Canada\u2019s Athlete of the Year and the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Medal. In her inspiring talks, Perdita explores what it means to chase a dream and overcome the \u201churdles\u201d life can put before you.\nIn high school, after briefly quitting track altogether, P erdita earned a full scholarship to the University of Illinois, and became a three time NCAA champion and a cademic standout. Her success continued as a professional when she represented Canada at six World Championship competitions, and at two Olympic Games in 2000 and 2004. A favourite at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Perdita fell at the first barrier in the finals and couldn\u2019t finish the ra ce. She showed grace under fire in that moment, and has used the experience to teach others how to pers evere and rise again. \nAfter retiring in 2013, Perdita has worked as a broadcaster, covering the 2015 Pan American Games and the summer Olympics in Rio for the CBC. Perdita credits a women\u2019s shelter in Durham Region with helping her family get on their feet. Her mother who immigrated from St. Lucia, encountered many barriers , including displacement and poverty, which she found a way to overcome. Perdita\u2019s story is incredibly emotional, and is loaded with raw honesty and humour.\nHighlighted this year will be the Prevention of Homelessness Among Families (PHAF) Program at Rotholme Women\u2019s & Family Shelter. Rotholme is a branch of Mission Services of London that offers safe shelter, nourishment, counseling and other support services to families in need, and PHAF is a perfect example. PHAF has three components: 1) Shelter Diversion, to help families at risk of homelessness avoid emergency shelter; 2) Housing Selection for families who cannot be diverted to help them find stable housing; and 3) Housing Stability to help families with life skills coaching and ongoing support after they exit emergency shelter."

The party attire is cocktail casual.\nI can't make the event, but I'd like to support the cause.  Can I make a donation?Yes!  You can make a donation when you select \"Register\".  A tax receipt will be issued following our event for any cash donations made through this Eventbrite page.\nWho is organizing this event?Dave and Robyn Way's son Miller is affected by autism and they have turned personally to these three organizations for support. Autism therapy is expensive and Robyn & Dave count themselves lucky that they can access therapies that help Miller without having to make meaningful sacrifices. Unfortunately, many other families are not as lucky. Core autism therapy is not covered by OHIP or most private benefits plans in the way that other disabilities and illnesses are covered. This event is Robyn & Dave's first step in a lifetime of (hopefully) giving back to the people who have been there for their family when they needed support most. They are thrilled to have a committee of amazing friends to help organize this years event.  \nWho do I contact with questions about the event?\nFeel free to reach out to any of the committee members or email bluetrolley.ca@gmail.com with any event-related questions.\nWhat autism charities will receive the proceeds from this event?The proceeds of Courts and Cocktail will benefit ISAND, Autism Dog Services, and Special Olympics Ontario.  Please read below for more information on these amazing organizations:\nISAND www.isand.caISAND is a non-profit organization with an integrated team of developmental pediatricians, psychologists, clinicians, and therapists.

As head of the El Salvadorian Consulate in Geneva during WW2, he turned the consulate into a secret printing press which provided documents that saved more than 50,000 Jews from death at the hands of the Nazis. Castellanos is commemorated at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, yet very few people know about his heroic efforts to save so many persecuted and innocent men, women and children. Had he been alive today he would have told us to \u201cSave the Yazidi.\u201d To view the film trailer and learn more, please visit https:\/\/www.filmconcertoforyazidis.com\/the-film.\nThis event is co-sponsored by the Canadian Coalition Against Terror and Beth Avraham Yoseph Synagogue.\nA tax receipt for a portion of the ticket will be issued on the night of the event."

        "Event Description": "The poor often lack the property rights and rule of law that would free them to pursue opportunities and escape poverty. They lack justice. The church should focus on this problem even though it rarely provides photo ops or quick fixes. This is not a call to a fleeting development fad. The Bible provides a strong foundation for property rights and the rule of law, and insists that human legal systems should protect every class of society, not just for the rich or well-connected. As the prophet Amos says, \u201cLet justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a neverfailing stream\u201d (NIV).\n\nPovertyCure is an initiative of the Acton Institute that seeks to ground the battle against local and global poverty in a proper understanding of the human person and society, and to encourage solutions that foster opportunity and unleash the entrepreneurial spirit that already fills poverty-stricken areas of the developed and developing world alike.\nIn an age of instant global media, great strides have been made in raising awareness about the problem of extreme poverty. This has sparked a growth in short-term mission campaigns, private charities, social entrepreneurship, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as tens of thousands of people have contributed money, vacation time, and whole careers to working with the poor. At the same time, during the past 60 years, the developed world has sent trillions of dollars in assistance to poor countries.Many of these efforts have done tremendous good. Unfortunately, some have not had the positive effects that were hoped for. This begs a fundamental question: How do we connect our desire to help with strategies that actually work? This is what we set out to explore in the PovertyCure Series.One of PovertyCure\u2019s key themes is the dignity and creative capacity of the human person created in the image of God. Understanding this is the foundation for everything we will explore, and it directly connects with a primary goal of the series\u2014to recover and illuminate the Christian tradition\u2019s rich treasury of resources for helping thepoor thrive.We explore the moral, theological, and economic foundations that allow people to create prosperity and get out of poverty, and do so in clear terms illustrated with stories by and about people who live and work in some of the world\u2019s poorest regions.\nThe goal throughout is to develop both hearts and minds for the poor."

The elevator will be added on to our entrance at 15 Lebreton St. N. (see image above). This will allow our current and future community members with disabilities to more easily and safely participate in the spiritual and community life of our parish, ensure that accessibility is not a barrier to welcoming visitors or potential new members, and increase our ability to partner with other organizations serving the local community.\nOur 2019 fundraising goal is $40,000 and we need all of your support to help us reach this goal!"

ESEs are businesses that create training and employment opportunities for people that face barriers to the labour market, including newcomers, people with disabilities, and people with mental illness -- businesses like Eva's Print Shop and Interpreter Services Toronto. \nThe evening will feature live pitches, and the opportunity to mingle and network with other members of the social enterprise community and business communities from Toronto, Peel and York Region. Please secure your ticket for the Pitch Night at your earliest convenience \u2013 and don\u2019t hesitate to pass along this invitation to other individuals and organizations in your network who might be interested.\nDinner and refreshments will be catered by a local employment social enterprise. If you have any accessibility needs or dietary restrictions for this event, please contact Courtney Ayukawa at cayukawa(@)uwgt.org.\nWe look forward to having you join us to celebrate our fourth cohort of entrepreneurs!"

        "Event Description": "Erasing Family spotlights the devastating consequences of parental alienation.\nIn the US and Canada, over 25 million parents are being erased from their children\u2019s lives after divorce or separation. The documentary follows young adults fighting to reunite with their broken families and offers solutions to make divorce healthier for kids.\nFor more information on this ground-breaking documentary, please visit the film website at https:\/\/erasingfamily.org\/\nThis event is hosted by the U of T Men's Issues Awareness Society. The Erasing Family tour is sponsored by the Canadian Association for Equality, a registered educational charity with a focus on gender equality.\nA loving parent being erased is one of the most significant public health crises of our time, with an estimated 3 million parents affected in Canada and 22 million in the US alone. The Erasing Family feature documentary reveals the trauma experienced by children when a loving, fit parent is erased from their lives due to separation and divorce. Through emotionally compelling stories, Director Ginger Gentile provides a road-map for parents and young people caught in families split by high-conflict divorce to reconnect. Family court professionals and legislatures will be moved to improve services for families. The goal of this film is to make separation and divorce healthier for our children.\nThe film's prequel, Erasing Dad, which explored parental alienation in South America, was originally banned from youtube because it exposed how some professionals make money from keeping fathers and children separated.The ban was overturned, the film became incredibly popular and it helped to improve family law in Argentina.\nTold from the point view of the children, Erasing Family attempts to heal from the consequences of courtroom decisions while endeavoring to build a DIY grassroots movement for social change. While the stories told are tragic, we show that happy endings are possible and inspire other children to reunite with their erased families.\nThe need is urgent. Although over 70% of Canadians support a presumption of equal parenting by mothers and fathers in the event of separation or divorce, and despite research showing that equal parenting has the best outcomes for children, legislative efforts have been repeatedly blocked. Efforts to reform family court by streamlining protocols and offering free or low cost mediation services remain fractured. We are determined to raise awareness that erasing family bonds after divorce or separation is one of the leading cause of preventable childhood trauma and through the film, trigger a mass movement to preserve family bonds.\nFilmmaker Ginger Gentile has a strong connection with the \"erased families\" community. Through her previous work directing Erasing Dad (2014) and creating the PSA Erased Mom (2016), and leading a 21,000+ Facebook page, she has become a leading advocate and in-demand public speaker. Ginger Gentile, has been named an architect of change by Maria Shriver for her work reuniting families and has robust support from family court professionals, advocates and families who desire for divorce and separation to be healthier for our children.\nErasing family bonds after divorce or separation is a leading cause of preventable childhood trauma. For change to happen, non-victims and institutions need to make divorce part of their agenda of social reform. Through personal narratives and legal analysis, Erasing Family educates families on how to make informed choices and mobilize representatives. Audiences will leave knowing that courtroom custody battles and their emotional consequences can be prevented with court reform and laws that promote shared parenting, as well as shifting resources to help families instead of encouraging them to fight."
