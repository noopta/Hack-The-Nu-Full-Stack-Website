The $20,000 goal that seemed unreachable had gone above & beyond all expectations.  After all expenses, The Little Steps Big Dreams Gala raised over $56,000 - with 240 people in attendance. 
$56,000 is the total amount that was distributed equally between particular initiatives at The Hospital for Sick Children and The Ronald McDonald House Charities Toronto during the 2018 holiday season, during a time where families need hope and love the  most.
This year, The Dream Bigger Gala has a goal of $60,000! Join us for an evening of charitable celebration as we continue to pave the way towards making big dreams come true, by DREAMING BIGGER.

The Refugee Highway Partnership is a network of Christians, churches and organizations who have found common cause in the call of Jesus to “welcome the stranger” and extend hospitality to those in need.  The Roundtable is where we gather -- the table is Round because we’re in this together and need one another’s voices.  It’s a place of inspiration, learning, sharing, and equipping.  It is a space where diverse ministries, services, and individuals find one another in order to bring about action that would please the heart of Jesus, as He sees us welcoming the stranger in our midst and showing the mercy that He first offered us.
 This year's theme is ""PLACE"" looking into thoughts from Exodus 33:21:
“Then the LORD said, ""There is a place near me where you may stand on a rock.”


We are also offering a pre-roundtable Professional Development training on Trauma Counselling.
Registration includes continental breakfasts and lunches!

Lansdowne Park 
Ottawa, ON K1S 5J3","Hopewell Eating Disorder Support Centre will hold its third annual signature fundraiser in the Horticulture Building at Lansdowne Park on Wednesday, October 23rd. It will bring people together to ""break bread"" and use this opportunity to further ""break stigma” around these deadly mental illnesses. 
This is important because while eating disorders are the most fatal mental health diagnosis, they remain grossly misunderstood and heavily stigmatized. Breaking bread together will give our guests a chance to learn more about why Hopewell's work is so vital in our community. 
The concept for the evening is a gourmet sandwich showdown, featuring a roster of Ottawa's top chefs, and a panel of celebrity judges to crown the ""Sandwich Sovereign of Ottawa""
The accomplished chefs who will be competing are: Cory Baird from Eldon’s, Shane Brown from Beckta, Justin Champagne from Bar Lupulus.  We are also welcoming back a team of new student chefs from the Algonquin College Culinary Management program!
The inaugural winner from 2017, Joe Thottungal from Coconut Lagoon, has signed on as the official Event Patron for Breaking Bread, Breaking Stigma! He is coming back this year to cook the reception food and he will also serve on the panel of celebrity judges, which includes local culinary royalty Margaret Dickenson, and Gusto Worldwide Media CEO Chris Knight.
Thank you to our event sponsors; GUSTO Worldwide Media, Excel HR, Taggart Parkes Foundation, Parson Refrigeration Ltd., Susan Chell Team - REMAX Hallmark Reality, INNOVISOR, Westboro Psychology, Pearly-Robertson, Hill and McDougall LLP, and Anchor Psychology. 

There will also be a silent auction of exciting prizes available on-site, and a bar featuring complementary wines from KIN Vineyards. Flora Hall will also be donating beer and fielding a chef for the competition (TBA).



FAQs 
Why are you holding a food-related event for an eating disorder charity?
Because food is the medicine that takes our clients from illness to wellness, and from hopelessness to recovery. It is also an opportunity to celebrate the amazing diversity of local chefs, whose life's work is providing this nourishment for all of us.
What accomodations will be made for those with dietary restrictions?

300 York Street 
London, ON N6B 1P8","Please join us on Thursday, November 14, 2019 at the London Convention Centre for our Fall Banquet & Silent Auction featuring keynote speaker Perdita Felicien, World Champion Hurdler and Two-Time Olympian.  
It is with great pleasure that we announce this year’s speaker: two-time Olympian, 10-time, National Champion, two-time World silver medalist, and the only Canadian woman to win a World Championship gold medal in track and field. During her career as a 100-metre hurdler she earned numerous honours, including Canada’s Athlete of the Year and the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Medal. In her inspiring talks, Perdita explores what it means to chase a dream and overcome the “hurdles” life can put before you.
In high school, after briefly quitting track altogether, P erdita earned a full scholarship to the University of Illinois, and became a three time NCAA champion and a cademic standout. Her success continued as a professional when she represented Canada at six World Championship competitions, and at two Olympic Games in 2000 and 2004. A favourite at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Perdita fell at the first barrier in the finals and couldn’t finish the ra ce. She showed grace under fire in that moment, and has used the experience to teach others how to pers evere and rise again. 
After retiring in 2013, Perdita has worked as a broadcaster, covering the 2015 Pan American Games and the summer Olympics in Rio for the CBC. Perdita credits a women’s shelter in Durham Region with helping her family get on their feet. Her mother who immigrated from St. Lucia, encountered many barriers , including displacement and poverty, which she found a way to overcome. Perdita’s story is incredibly emotional, and is loaded with raw honesty and humour.
Highlighted this year will be the Prevention of Homelessness Among Families (PHAF) Program at Rotholme Women’s & Family Shelter. Rotholme is a branch of Mission Services of London that offers safe shelter, nourishment, counseling and other support services to families in need, and PHAF is a perfect example. PHAF has three components: 1) Shelter Diversion, to help families at risk of homelessness avoid emergency shelter; 2) Housing Selection for families who cannot be diverted to help them find stable housing; and 3) Housing Stability to help families with life skills coaching and ongoing support after they exit emergency shelter."

The Refugee Highway Partnership is a network of Christians, churches and organizations who have found common cause in the call of Jesus to “welcome the stranger” and extend hospitality to those in need.  The Roundtable is where we gather -- the table is Round because we’re in this together and need one another’s voices.  It’s a place of inspiration, learning, sharing, and equipping.  It is a space where diverse ministries, services, and individuals find one another in order to bring about action that would please the heart of Jesus, as He sees us welcoming the stranger in our midst and showing the mercy that He first offered us.
 This year's theme is ""PLACE"" looking into thoughts from Exodus 33:21:
“Then the LORD said, ""There is a place near me where you may stand on a rock.”


We are also offering a pre-roundtable Professional Development training on Trauma Counselling.
Registration includes continental breakfasts and lunches!

1525 Princess Patricia Way 
Lansdowne Park 
Ottawa, ON K1S 5J3","Hopewell Eating Disorder Support Centre will hold its third annual signature fundraiser in the Horticulture Building at Lansdowne Park on Wednesday, October 23rd. It will bring people together to ""break bread"" and use this opportunity to further ""break stigma” around these deadly mental illnesses. 
This is important because while eating disorders are the most fatal mental health diagnosis, they remain grossly misunderstood and heavily stigmatized. Breaking bread together will give our guests a chance to learn more about why Hopewell's work is so vital in our community. 
The concept for the evening is a gourmet sandwich showdown, featuring a roster of Ottawa's top chefs, and a panel of celebrity judges to crown the ""Sandwich Sovereign of Ottawa""
The accomplished chefs who will be competing are: Cory Baird from Eldon’s, Shane Brown from Beckta, Justin Champagne from Bar Lupulus.  We are also welcoming back a team of new student chefs from the Algonquin College Culinary Management program!
The inaugural winner from 2017, Joe Thottungal from Coconut Lagoon, has signed on as the official Event Patron for Breaking Bread, Breaking Stigma! He is coming back this year to cook the reception food and he will also serve on the panel of celebrity judges, which includes local culinary royalty Margaret Dickenson, and Gusto Worldwide Media CEO Chris Knight.
Thank you to our event sponsors; GUSTO Worldwide Media, Excel HR, Taggart Parkes Foundation, Parson Refrigeration Ltd., Susan Chell Team - REMAX Hallmark Reality, INNOVISOR, Westboro Psychology, Pearly-Robertson, Hill and McDougall LLP, and Anchor Psychology. 

There will also be a silent auction of exciting prizes available on-site, and a bar featuring complementary wines from KIN Vineyards. Flora Hall will also be donating beer and fielding a chef for the competition (TBA).



FAQs 
Why are you holding a food-related event for an eating disorder charity?
Because food is the medicine that takes our clients from illness to wellness, and from hopelessness to recovery. It is also an opportunity to celebrate the amazing diversity of local chefs, whose life's work is providing this nourishment for all of us.
What accomodations will be made for those with dietary restrictions?
Due to the nature of the event, the chefs are only able to make adjustments for vegetarians (by providing an alternate protein), and those with Celiac disease or a severe gluten allergy (by using gluten-free bread). Please email info@hopewell.ca after you have purchased your tickets to inform us if you require either or both of these adjustments to be made for you. Those who do not inform the organizers in advance of these requirements may not be able to be accomodated on-site.
Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?
No, however a host bar will be available for those aged 19 and older. Non-alcoholic options will also be available.
Will you be issuing a tax receipt to ticket buyers?
Absolutely! Tax receipts will be issued by the end of November 2019.
What are my transportation/parking options for getting to and from the event?
Lansdowne Park is easily accessible by walking and cycling. OC Transpo service on Bank Street also provides easy connections from downtown. The underground parking garage has over 1000 spots available at rates of $2.00 for 30 minutes, and a $30 daily maximum.
How can I contact the organizer with any questions?
Please email info@hopewell.ca 
What's the refund policy?
No refunds will be provided after ticket purchase."

London, ON N6B 1P8","Please join us on Thursday, November 14, 2019 at the London Convention Centre for our Fall Banquet & Silent Auction featuring keynote speaker Perdita Felicien, World Champion Hurdler and Two-Time Olympian.  
It is with great pleasure that we announce this year’s speaker: two-time Olympian, 10-time, National Champion, two-time World silver medalist, and the only Canadian woman to win a World Championship gold medal in track and field. During her career as a 100-metre hurdler she earned numerous honours, including Canada’s Athlete of the Year and the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Medal. In her inspiring talks, Perdita explores what it means to chase a dream and overcome the “hurdles” life can put before you.
In high school, after briefly quitting track altogether, P erdita earned a full scholarship to the University of Illinois, and became a three time NCAA champion and a cademic standout. Her success continued as a professional when she represented Canada at six World Championship competitions, and at two Olympic Games in 2000 and 2004. A favourite at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Perdita fell at the first barrier in the finals and couldn’t finish the ra ce. She showed grace under fire in that moment, and has used the experience to teach others how to pers evere and rise again. 
After retiring in 2013, Perdita has worked as a broadcaster, covering the 2015 Pan American Games and the summer Olympics in Rio for the CBC. Perdita credits a women’s shelter in Durham Region with helping her family get on their feet. Her mother who immigrated from St. Lucia, encountered many barriers , including displacement and poverty, which she found a way to overcome. Perdita’s story is incredibly emotional, and is loaded with raw honesty and humour.
Highlighted this year will be the Prevention of Homelessness Among Families (PHAF) Program at Rotholme Women’s & Family Shelter. Rotholme is a branch of Mission Services of London that offers safe shelter, nourishment, counseling and other support services to families in need, and PHAF is a perfect example. PHAF has three components: 1) Shelter Diversion, to help families at risk of homelessness avoid emergency shelter; 2) Housing Selection for families who cannot be diverted to help them find stable housing; and 3) Housing Stability to help families with life skills coaching and ongoing support after they exit emergency shelter."

Toronto, ON M5V 3G5","Let The Elephants Dance is an event created to help raise awareness of mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety. We have been proudly donating to both The Canadian Mental Health Association in Toronto and Kids Help Phone each year. Let The Elephants Dance is a safe place for artists to showcase their work, their stories, their heartbreak and most importantly: the battles they have won, to give hope to those still suffering. Our goal is to present the issues and triumphs over said issues through performance, without stigma. There is only encouragement, love and support at our events. 
It is understood by us at Let the Elephants Dance, that everyone’s battles with mental health is both personal and yet a universal struggle. Our goal is that this event can demonstrate hope for the daily battle for those who struggle with their mental health, all while raising the needed funds for the above charities, so they can continue their essential services.
From our guest orators, to singers, poets, and dancers – we all come together to share a message of hope and understanding.

FAQs
Do I need to play tennis?No! We expect many more non-tennis players than actual players so if you just want to party that's great.
What is the recommended attire?Tennis players are required to adhere to the TLTC dress code (all whites).  The party attire is cocktail casual.
I can't make the event, but I'd like to support the cause.  Can I make a donation?Yes!  You can make a donation when you select ""Register"".  A tax receipt will be issued following our event for any cash donations made through this Eventbrite page.
Who is organizing this event?Dave and Robyn Way's son Miller is affected by autism and they have turned personally to these three organizations for support. Autism therapy is expensive and Robyn & Dave count themselves lucky that they can access therapies that help Miller without having to make meaningful sacrifices. Unfortunately, many other families are not as lucky. Core autism therapy is not covered by OHIP or most private benefits plans in the way that other disabilities and illnesses are covered. This event is Robyn & Dave's first step in a lifetime of (hopefully) giving back to the people who have been there for their family when they needed support most. They are thrilled to have a committee of amazing friends to help organize this years event.  
Who do I contact with questions about the event?
Feel free to reach out to any of the committee members or email bluetrolley.ca@gmail.com with any event-related questions.
What autism charities will receive the proceeds from this event?The proceeds of Courts and Cocktail will benefit ISAND, Autism Dog Services, and Special Olympics Ontario.  Please read below for more information on these amazing organizations:
ISAND www.isand.caISAND is a non-profit organization with an integrated team of developmental pediatricians, psychologists, clinicians, and therapists. ISAND delivers fully integrated, coordinated and continued care and the generosity of individual and corporate donors and sponsors makes it possible for ISAND to offer the best possible service, regardless of a family’s ability to pay.
Autism Dog Services http://www.autismdogservices.ca/ADS fosters the integration of children with autism by training, placing and supporting dogs that offer safety, companionship and independence. Founded in 2007, ADS is accredited with Assistance Dogs International and is also a member of the Canadian Association of Guide and Assistance Dog Schools.

Special Olympics has grown from a modest program serving local athletes to become the world’s largest movement dedicated to promoting respect, acceptance, inclusion, and human dignity for people with intellectual disabilities through sports.

The incredible documentary film ""The Rescue"" will be shown, accompanied by a live band. ""The Rescue"" tells the incredible story of Colonel Jose Arturo Castellanos Contreras. As head of the El Salvadorian Consulate in Geneva during WW2, he turned the consulate into a secret printing press which provided documents that saved more than 50,000 Jews from death at the hands of the Nazis. Castellanos is commemorated at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, yet very few people know about his heroic efforts to save so many persecuted and innocent men, women and children. Had he been alive today he would have told us to “Save the Yazidi.” To view the film trailer and learn more, please visit https://www.filmconcertoforyazidis.com/the-film.
This event is co-sponsored by the Canadian Coalition Against Terror and Beth Avraham Yoseph Synagogue.

The Bible provides a strong foundation for property rights and the rule of law, and insists that human legal systems should protect every class of society, not just for the rich or well-connected. As the prophet Amos says, “Let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a neverfailing stream” (NIV).

PovertyCure is an initiative of the Acton Institute that seeks to ground the battle against local and global poverty in a proper understanding of the human person and society, and to encourage solutions that foster opportunity and unleash the entrepreneurial spirit that already fills poverty-stricken areas of the developed and developing world alike.
In an age of instant global media, great strides have been made in raising awareness about the problem of extreme poverty. This has sparked a growth in short-term mission campaigns, private charities, social entrepreneurship, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as tens of thousands of people have contributed money, vacation time, and whole careers to working with the poor. At the same time, during the past 60 years, the developed world has sent trillions of dollars in assistance to poor countries.Many of these efforts have done tremendous good. Unfortunately, some have not had the positive effects that were hoped for. This begs a fundamental question: How do we connect our desire to help with strategies that actually work? This is what we set out to explore in the PovertyCure Series.One of PovertyCure’s key themes is the dignity and creative capacity of the human person created in the image of God. Understanding this is the foundation for everything we will explore, and it directly connects with a primary goal of the series—to recover and illuminate the Christian tradition’s rich treasury of resources for helping thepoor thrive.We explore the moral, theological, and economic foundations that allow people to create prosperity and get out of poverty, and do so in clear terms illustrated with stories by and about people who live and work in some of the world’s poorest regions.
The goal throughout is to develop both hearts and minds for the poor."

Tickets will be on sale at the Cathedral (15 Lebreton St. N.) on Sundays after Liturgy starting in September.

Accessibility Project
Over the last year and a half we have been raising funds to improve the accessibility of our building by installing an elevator. The elevator will be added on to our entrance at 15 Lebreton St. N. (see image above). This will allow our current and future community members with disabilities to more easily and safely participate in the spiritual and community life of our parish, ensure that accessibility is not a barrier to welcoming visitors or potential new members, and increase our ability to partner with other organizations serving the local community.
Our 2019 fundraising goal is $40,000 and we need all of your support to help us reach this goal!"

All proceeds go to support our Accessibility Project.

There will be a cash bar open throughout the evening.
Tickets will be on sale at the Cathedral (15 Lebreton St. N.) on Sundays after Liturgy starting in September.

Accessibility Project
Over the last year and a half we have been raising funds to improve the accessibility of our building by installing an elevator. The elevator will be added on to our entrance at 15 Lebreton St. N. (see image above). This will allow our current and future community members with disabilities to more easily and safely participate in the spiritual and community life of our parish, ensure that accessibility is not a barrier to welcoming visitors or potential new members, and increase our ability to partner with other organizations serving the local community.
Our 2019 fundraising goal is $40,000 and we need all of your support to help us reach this goal!"

There is plenty of free parking at the RA Centre.
What's for dinner?
Plated (sit-down) dinner - Optional vegan and gluten free orders are available, but must be advance ordered by calling Wendy at 613-796-3063.
Is this for children?
This is an event intended for adults, however, the topics for discussion and activities are all ""child-friendly"".  We have had children attend as guests in the past without issue.  It's up to  you!
Can I wait and purchase my ticket at the door?
Due to the need to give advance notice to the RA Centre Chef, and the fact that we are having a plated dinner this year, we are not able to sell tickets at the door.  However, arrangements may be made the day of the banquet up to 2:00 pm for special circumstances by calling the CityKidz office at 613-796-3063.

During the evening of celebration we'll see 5-6 participants pitch their business ideas to a panel of expert judges in hopes of winning $5,000 - 10,000 of Catalyzing funding. 
The Pitch competition is the culmination of a 3-month accelerator program, which has supported approximately 20 individuals and organizations in Toronto, Peel and York Region to develop early-stage employment social enterprise (ESE) ideas that will train and employ youth facing barriers. ESEs are businesses that create training and employment opportunities for people that face barriers to the labour market, including newcomers, people with disabilities, and people with mental illness -- businesses like Eva's Print Shop and Interpreter Services Toronto. 
The evening will feature live pitches, and the opportunity to mingle and network with other members of the social enterprise community and business communities from Toronto, Peel and York Region. Please secure your ticket for the Pitch Night at your earliest convenience – and don’t hesitate to pass along this invitation to other individuals and organizations in your network who might be interested.
Dinner and refreshments will be catered by a local employment social enterprise. If you have any accessibility needs or dietary restrictions for this event, please contact Courtney Ayukawa at cayukawa(@)uwgt.org.
We look forward to having you join us to celebrate our fourth cohort of entrepreneurs!"

En faisant la promotion de son programme de bourses et programme communautaire pour enfants et adolescents.
En tant qu’école d’art à but non lucratif, l’ÉAO facilite l’accès à des cours d’art, offerts par des artistes et enseignants professionnels, à des centaines d’étudiants chaque année grâce à son programme de bourses et programme communautaire. Afin de permettre la viabilité de ce programme, l’ÉAO collabore avec neuf différents centres et maisons communautaires. Grâce à notre programme de bourses, nous enrichissons la vie de nombreuses personnes qui ne peuvent pas se permettre d’envoyer leurs enfants à des cours d’art ou des camps d’été ou de suivre des cours pour eux-mêmes. Ce programme existe depuis plus de 30 ans. Chaque année, l’ÉAO offre des bourses allant de 150 $ à 300 $, principalement aux enfants et aux jeunes. Joignez-vous à nous et faites preuve d’engagement envers l’éducation artistique et la culture à Ottawa.
Notre événement aura lieu le mercredi 23 octobre de 18 h à 21 h, au Orange Art Galelry.

1 King's College Circle 
Toronto, Ontario M5S3K1","Erasing Family spotlights the devastating consequences of parental alienation.
In the US and Canada, over 25 million parents are being erased from their children’s lives after divorce or separation. The documentary follows young adults fighting to reunite with their broken families and offers solutions to make divorce healthier for kids.
For more information on this ground-breaking documentary, please visit the film website at https://erasingfamily.org/
This event is hosted by the U of T Men's Issues Awareness Society. The Erasing Family tour is sponsored by the Canadian Association for Equality, a registered educational charity with a focus on gender equality.
A loving parent being erased is one of the most significant public health crises of our time, with an estimated 3 million parents affected in Canada and 22 million in the US alone. The Erasing Family feature documentary reveals the trauma experienced by children when a loving, fit parent is erased from their lives due to separation and divorce. Through emotionally compelling stories, Director Ginger Gentile provides a road-map for parents and young people caught in families split by high-conflict divorce to reconnect. Family court professionals and legislatures will be moved to improve services for families. The goal of this film is to make separation and divorce healthier for our children.
The film's prequel, Erasing Dad, which explored parental alienation in South America, was originally banned from youtube because it exposed how some professionals make money from keeping fathers and children separated.The ban was overturned, the film became incredibly popular and it helped to improve family law in Argentina.
Told from the point view of the children, Erasing Family attempts to heal from the consequences of courtroom decisions while endeavoring to build a DIY grassroots movement for social change. While the stories told are tragic, we show that happy endings are possible and inspire other children to reunite with their erased families.
The need is urgent. Although over 70% of Canadians support a presumption of equal parenting by mothers and fathers in the event of separation or divorce, and despite research showing that equal parenting has the best outcomes for children, legislative efforts have been repeatedly blocked. Efforts to reform family court by streamlining protocols and offering free or low cost mediation services remain fractured. We are determined to raise awareness that erasing family bonds after divorce or separation is one of the leading cause of preventable childhood trauma and through the film, trigger a mass movement to preserve family bonds.
Filmmaker Ginger Gentile has a strong connection with the ""erased families"" community. Through her previous work directing Erasing Dad (2014) and creating the PSA Erased Mom (2016), and leading a 21,000+ Facebook page, she has become a leading advocate and in-demand public speaker. Ginger Gentile, has been named an architect of change by Maria Shriver for her work reuniting families and has robust support from family court professionals, advocates and families who desire for divorce and separation to be healthier for our children.
Erasing family bonds after divorce or separation is a leading cause of preventable childhood trauma. For change to happen, non-victims and institutions need to make divorce part of their agenda of social reform. Through personal narratives and legal analysis, Erasing Family educates families on how to make informed choices and mobilize representatives. Audiences will leave knowing that courtroom custody battles and their emotional consequences can be prevented with court reform and laws that promote shared parenting, as well as shifting resources to help families instead of encouraging them to fight."

The Gift of Kindness Fundraising Dinner is a chance for you to contribute to a very meaningful program which impacts thousands of lives each year. A chance to contribute a unique, Burlington event which happens every Friday night, of every month, all year long at Wellington Square United Church. Each week, a community of over 250 individuals come together to share a free meal, friendship and support. An amazing team of over 70 volunteers also give their time to this community program which was awarded the 2012 YMCA Group Peace Medal Award, among other recognitions.
The guests which attend the weekly Friday Night Community Supper come from Burlington and Hamilton and are men, women and children who are looking for a community of friends and people to care. Some may be persons socially isolated by disability and/or poverty or may be single parents or seniors. The thing they have in common? A desire to be seen, heard and accepted.
The Event:
Our first annual Gift of Kindness Fundraising Dinner will feature a gourmet meal, live music, a silent auction and a chance for you to learn more about giving where you live! We hope you’ll join us.
 
Date: Thursday, November 28th
Time: 6PM  Mocktails, Appetizers and live music!
